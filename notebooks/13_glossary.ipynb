    "  - Disambiguation: the term qubit can refer to the actual physical device in which information is stored (e.g., transmon qubit), and it can also refer to the unit of information itself that is stored in the state of those physical devices. In quantum information, a qubit is any two-level quantum system in a coherent state of superposition. It is often a superposition of the ocupation of the two lowest quantized energy levels of any quantum system. The term \"qubit\" is attributed to Benjamin Schumacher [[1]](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.51.2738).\n",

    "  - Statevector representation: is a vector of $d$ components in a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$ of dimension $\\dim(\\mathcal{H})=d$ with an orthonormal basis set composed of $d$ linear independent (LI) vectors. \n",
    "  - Density matrix representation: is a $d$x$d$ unitary matrix from the $SU(d)$ group of degree $d$ (dimension).\n",
    "  - Examples:\n",
    "    - Qubit: a quantum system of 2 energy levels whose density matrix is represented by a 2x2 matrix.\n",
