    "- **Q: \"Why must all quantum observables be Hermitian?\"**\n",
    "  - Answer: Quantum observables are linear operators describing physical quantities and, therefore, they must have real eigenvalues $\\lambda_j = \\lambda_j^*$, hence they should be represented by Hermitian matrices. Within the matrix mechanics formalism of quantum mechanics, initially developed by Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan, the physical observables (e.g., `hamiltonian`, `electric charge`, `magnetic flux`, `position`, `momentum`, etc.) are represented by self-adjoint (Hermitian) operators where the corresponding eigenvectors form a set of orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space."

In open quantum systems, the dynamics (evolution) under a quantum channel can be represented by a Unitary operation acting on the global mixed¹ state of the composite Hilbert space (system of interest² + environment). However, the evolution of the system of interest, treated in isolation after tracing out the environment, is described by a non-unitary operation. The reason is that, via system-environment interactions, the environment will couple with the system creating correlations in such a way that it causes decoherence (a non-unitary process) in the system of interest, and sometimes entanglement³ between the two subsystems."

    "¹In noisy quantum systems, incoherent noise creates a mixed state, i.e, a probability distribution over pure states. Although a mixed state (see Ref. [1]) consists of an ensemble (statistical mixture) of $N$ pure states ($\\{p_j, |\\psi_j\\rangle\\}_{j=1}^n$), a mixed state cannot be represented by a linear combination of the aforementioned normalized state vectors (pure states) that are defined on a separable Hilbert Space. Therefore, the evolved mixed state must be represented by a [mixed density operator](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-quantum-hardware/density-matrix.html#:~:text=corrupted) rather than a statevector. Recall that coherent noise is described by unitary operations, while incoherent noise generates mixed states that are always random, regardless of the basis in which they are measured.\n",

It is possible to create entanglement even if the two systems are initially uncorrelated, but there must be coherence in one of them.
